;;; Commentary:

;; This package allows flanges to be easily frobnicated.

;;;; Usage

;; Run one of these commands:

;; `package-name-command': Frobnicate the flange.

;;;;; Tips

;; + You can customize settings in the `package-name' group.

;;;; Installation

;;;;; Package manager

;; If you've installed it with your package manager, you're done.
;; `package-name' is autoloaded, so you can call it right away.

;;;;; Manual

;; Install these required packages:

;; + foo
;; + bar

;; Then put this file in your load-path, and put the following in your init
;; file:

;; (require 'package-name)

;;;; Credits

;; This package would not have been possible without the following
;; packages: foo[1], which showed me how to bifurcate, and bar[2],
;; which takes care of flanges.

;;  [1] https://example.com/foo.el
;;  [2] https://example.com/bar.el

  "This setting does something."

               [remap search-forward] #'package-name-search-forward
               )))
